If you take an ice-cold shower after the house has cooled down at night , you will actually feel cold for a moment. But when you put on your clothes and have all these lights, have all these lights, you warm up again very quickly.

It's not just warm outside, it's hot and sizzling. Greetings to you and greetings to you.

Let’s take a look at thunderstorms. First and foremost now.

Today there is a risk of isolated very heavy showers and very heavy showers and thunderstorm cells. Once in the Wogesen, thunderstorm cells.

Once in the Wogesen, then from the Black Forest, later towards the then from the Black Forest, later towards the Alps and then into Middle Franconia and again the Alps, especially in the east of Switzerland, in the Allu Alps up to the Tyrolean Oberland, partly also into the western Unterland partly also into the western Unterland then further down towards and then further down towards South Tyrol.

It won't affect everyone, South Tyrol. It won't affect everyone, but the problem is that these showers but the problem is that these showers and thunderstorm cells are stationary.

This results in incredibly high amounts of precipitation. There were already severe floods and devastation in the Stubeier Alps yesterday, so much rain fell on one place that there could be mudslides and floods, even hailstorms, which is the case today.

Tomorrow we'll have something similar the case today. Tomorrow we'll have something similar again the Alps.

Not quite as again the Alps. Not quite as strong, but there is a zone in the northwest where the hot air will meet cooler air and the air will also become more humid overall.

Until the evening there is a high risk of severe weather in NRW and then across to southern Meelenburg Vorpommern and also from western also from western Schleswig-Holstein via western Lower Saxony into the neighboring Benelux countries, with Benelux countries, with strong thunderstorms, which are strong thunderstorms, which are mainly stationary.

After the thunderstorms, there will also be storm squalls and the risk of hurricane squalls, and it will also be very windy. Towards the evening the whole thing will probably move further towards Schleswig-Holstein, initially with the potential for severe weather, and in the south the whole thing will move a bit and then on Thursday we will have the highest risk of heavy showers and thunderstorms directly on the Alps, even locally , because the last of the hot air that is , because the last of the hot air that is moist here will then be squeezed out and on Friday the whole thing will then shift to the south of Styria, southern Burgenland also to Lower Carinthia.

After that it stops for a short time and then gets warmer again. Speaking of warmer, with the warmth comes Sahara sand Sahara dust.

Especially on the Rhine and west of it, the Sahara and west of it, the Sahara dust pollution will increase tomorrow, Wednesday, in the northwest half, where, among other things, temperatures are at their highest. And the Sahara sand Sahara dust can prevent the absolute extremes by up to 2° because the sun is dimmed a bit.

On Thursday the whole thing is above the middle, on Friday it more middle, on Friday it more or less dissolves and then it is no longer so important. But it will come back a little bit.

Let’s look at the back a little bit. Let’s look at the air mass temperature.

Tonight at 8 p.m. the temperature in the central western half will be the temperature in the central western half will be around 20-21°.

That's extremely high and if we add the usual 15°, we get 36-37°. But you can we get 36-37°.

But you can count on up to 18°. Therefore, count on up to 18°.

Therefore, theoretically, 38 or 39° would also be theoretically, 38 or 39° would also be possible. What's interesting is that there's even possible.

What's interesting is that there's even a circle in there from the thunderstorm cell a circle in there from the thunderstorm cell that's being calculated here. Tomorrow at 2 that's being calculated here.

Tomorrow at 2 p.m. the temperature at an altitude of 1500 m p.m.

the temperature at an altitude of 1500 m in the center and in the west will be 20 to 21, occasionally 22°. Very high.

but not as high as calculated a few days ago. It was still 25 or 26°.

That's why you always have to pay attention to what will happen in a week or a week and a half. This usually always calculated down a little bit .

And these are the absolute temperatures that are supposed to come then. Here at 5 p.m.

today, we have 37° along the Rein and also here on the Niederreihin and in the western Ruhr area. At 7 p.m.

We'll go back again. Look, that's where go back again.

Look, that's where the thunderstorm cell is supposed to come. the thunderstorm cell is supposed to come.

The whole thing cools down due to the thunderstorms. These are the very finely resolved local models.

And if finely resolved local models. And if we look at tomorrow at 5 p.m., we'll have 38, 39° along the Rhine, even 40°C, and here in the east it's 38, sometimes 39°C.

And 38, sometimes 39°C. And watch out, we're going two hours further and you'll see how the heat is easing a bit here and a zone with much fresher air is coming in from the northwest from the North Sea and this exactly where the greatest risk of severe weather is, the greatest risk of severe weather is, because the cold front will bring the whole thing down .

But is it soup? Let’s take a quick look at the dew points.

You know dew points: when the air is cooled down , it eventually becomes saturated, can , it eventually becomes saturated, can no longer absorb moisture and no longer absorb moisture and fog forms. And the lower the dew point, the drier the air.

And we feel the sultry feeling at 16° + X and that is today at 5 p.m. Where the foam and thunderstorms are expected to form in the southwest, the dew points will be between 13 and 20°.

They are also in the single digits in the northwest in the low mountain ranges and towards the east and towards the east . This means the .

This means the air is very dry. This means that when the sun shines, the air heats up quickly and when the sun disappears, it also cools down quickly.

Only in the east do we have something over Only in the east do we have something over 10°, then here in the southeast of Bavaria below 10°, in the west around 20°. You can cut the air and then You can cut the air and then tomorrow at 11 a.m.

a very tropical air mass will pass in the west, not so much in the east and then something very, very interesting will happen. With the wind only slightly freshening, the air dries out over the freshening, the air dries out over the course of the day, also due to the high position of the sun and this air mass itself.

It is actually very dry, itself. It is actually very dry, otherwise it wouldn't be so extremely warm or hot.

This means that in the regions where we are supposed to get up to 40°, the get up to 40°, the air is very dry, like in the desert, and therefore quite bearable, except directly on the edge of the Alps around the Black Forest and in the northwest. And it is right here, along the line of this dry air, that the greatest risk of showers and thunderstorms lies.

I personally find it very exciting and interesting. The precipitation that is expected until Friday according to the German Eiken model shows the thunderstorm activity around the Alps and in the far northwest.

The other thing here is averaged thunderstorms or grid points. There can be 30 lunar clouds locally and not a drop of rain a kilometer away, and then it's all averaged out.

And the American GFS model makes the temperature and precipitation distribution similar due to the showers and thunderstorms. Let’s move on to precipitation.

The on to precipitation. The European ECMWF model predicts a zone of less precipitation in the far northwest and more in the Alps over the next two weeks , just as we discussed this morning .

The so-called zero run from this morning is making a big difference in the Alpine region. The six-race here would then bring a trail of rain through would then bring a trail of rain through Slovakia and the Czech Republic all the way into Poland.

That would be a 5B location. For example, if it came a little further west, it would be wet here, if it moved further east, nothing would happen and in the northwest there would be rain here too.

This morning's main run from the American GFS model is a hot outlier. If that were to happen, we would have a deviation of almost 5° plus by the 16th.

That would bring us to the year 2006 , as I explained this morning. , as I explained this morning.

This would be the weather situation for July 17th after the main run of the American GFS model classic Omega. Here GFS model classic Omega.

Here again, high-reaching warm or hot air again, high-reaching warm or hot air with temperatures of around and above 20° at with temperatures of around and above 20° at 1500 m altitude would be a new heat wave. 1500 m altitude would be a new heat wave.

But that is still a very, very long way But that is still a very, very long way off. The average of the calculations sees the Azores high with a wedge of the Azores high reaching us.

North of this south of this high axis it would be hotter. This will then go up again will then go up again next week after the low pressure influence .

And the so-called six-cycle, I so-called six-cycle, I just told you about this small low, which would still be circling here and circling here and bring showers and thunderstorms to this area, and the dry, high-reaching hot air would then be a little further west. then be a little further west.

That's why you can't say when or That's why you can't say when or how this will happen. Here the temperatures are cooler.

This time the great heat again over France. Let’s look at an ensemble, specifically for Erfurt.

The red line is the long-term The red line is the long-term average. The white line is the mean of all calculations.

There is the heat, which ends with a light thunderstorm. ends with a light thunderstorm.

Then it goes up again on the weekend, then down. Cooler with rain next week.

Then a slow warm-up. The main and control runs are high up according to this model.

The European ECMWFM makes the whole structure similar. However, whole structure similar.

However, a two is a two is hot at the back. Class 2 would remain lower with some precipitation.

In any case, there will be any case, there will be a chance and an option for rain next week and significantly cooler temperatures. Last but not least, I brought two meteograms because of the heat here.

The meteogram for Düsseldorf. That's the American model, that's the European model.

This the American run from this afternoon, not the extreme one from this morning. We're still seeing the heat and then it's going down.

We'll be touching the 30° mark again towards the weekend . Next week .

Next week both models predict rain and a significant drop in temperature. After that there will be an increase and by the middle of the month middle of the month the 30° mark would be reached again.

Then let's cool off a bit . And before I say anything else about this , I was just contacted before I went into the studio and was told that somewhere in an earlier newspaper article earlier newspaper article I was quoted as saying that the warmer years are over.

I wanted to say something about that . I gave a talk at the time and at the end of the talk, how to do this, you present different do this, you present different scenarios.

Scenario where it gets scenarios. Scenario where it gets hotter, scenario where it stays like this and a scenario where it gets cooler.

And there are various And there are various research results that you can easily google. And with these research results, these research results, on the other hand, I first presented the hot side and then the cold side and said that if that happens, the 30s and 40s would bring different 40s would bring different climatic conditions, which climatic conditions, which would be roughly similar to the 70s and 80s here, and then the hot years would be over.

That's what I said back then and that's what I always say in my lectures. And now we go to the Leutasche and in the background is the high Munde with the clear mountain air.
