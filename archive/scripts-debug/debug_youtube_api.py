Debug YouTube Transcript Issues (DEPRECATED)

This script was used to debug youtube-transcript-api issues, but that method
has been removed from the main tool due to frequent blocking on cloud servers.

The main tool now uses only yt-dlp, which is more reliable.
Use the main youtube_to_mcp.py script instead.
